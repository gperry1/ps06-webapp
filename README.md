## Overview

- My data is called “Freedom in the World” and was originally accessed through the open
source data project “tidytuesday”
- The dataset itself was created by Arthur Cheib, but the data he collected is originally
from the United Nations and Freedom House
- The dataset is essentially a collection of countries with data spanning from 2005-2021 that
indicates whether a country is “free” or not, including variables like the amount of civil
liberties a country has, the amount of political rights a country has, and whether a country
is developed or not

## About Data

This page just gives a brief description of the dataset and what it measures

## Plot

Below, you will find documentation on the different widgets and different variables being measured:

### Variables:

- **year:** A variable that measures the year of the observations in the dataset
- **region:** A variable that describes the different world regions that the observations in the dataset belong to
- **avg_total:** A variable that measures the Average Total Freedom level of the countries in a given region

### Widgets:

- **Singular checkBox:** Allows the user to show the trend lines for the scatterplot on the main panel
- **Grouped checkBox:** Allows the user to show a scatterplot for the different regions in the dataset

## Table

Below, you will find documentation on only the different widgets being measured, as I used the same variables as I did in the _Plot_ tab:

### Widgets:

- **Slider:** Allows the user to see a ranking of the Average Total Freedom level of the different regions based on the year

## WebApp

You can find a link to the webapp I've created [here]( https://graydonperry.shinyapps.io/ps06-webapp/)

(For reference, I probably spent around 8 hours on this assignment)
